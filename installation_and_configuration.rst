Installation and Configuration
==============================



Installation Steps
------------------

Install the App
***********************

There are 3 ways to install the app:

1.  Install the app from within Splunk "Manage Apps" > "Browse More Apps" page (requires Splunk to have internet access)
2.  Install the DB Cybertech Splunk App by downloading the latest release from `DB Cybertech Splunk App <https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4042/>`_.
3.  Download the beta code, from `Github <https://github.com/DBCybertech/App-DB_CyberTech>`_

Configure App-DB_CyberTech
---------------------------
1. If using along with `DB Cybertech Add-on for Splunk <https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3587/>`_ , it is highly recommended to restart Splunk from ``Settings > Server Control`` page to make sure that the APP and TA assets are loaded.
2. Although the dashboards can be further customized by user, no further app configuration is needed to start monitoring the events.
